<h1>Eye tracking analysis</h1>

Final MSc project titled <b>Neurodiverse and Neurotypical Facial Perception Patterns of Abstract Paintings: An Eye-tracking study</b>. Primary eye-tracking research was collected using TOBII eye-tracking software from 24 participants, 12 neurotypical and 12 neurodiverse, with a range of different neurodifferences: ADHD, autism, dyslexia, intellectual disabilities and other support needs. Saccade and fixation eye-tracking measure datasets were combined with demographic data. R was used to combine datasets, for data cleaning, visualisations and statistical analysis. Neurodiverse research has shown a general consensus that there are significant differences in visual perception patterns, with decreased focus on central features of the face as compared to those who are neurotypical. Art literature has shown that neurotypical individuals perception patterns differ as art becomes more abstract. This study sought to expand neurodiverse literature on facial perception patterns into a field where it has yet to be investigated: to investigate how previous neurodiverse findings translate and differ when facial imagery becomes increasingly abstract. This project is in the process of publication.

Eye-tracking data was collected using 25 black and white images ranging from facial photography, portrait paintings, semi-abstract paintings, abstract and very abstract paintings (seen below) shown in a randomised order.

Heatmaps and scanpaths were created in TOBII software as preliminary visualisations with generalised heatmaps for each level of abstractness (ND top and ND below):
